### Problems and solutions

1.
Issue: No prior knowledge of TypeScript

Solution: I started by reading and watching some material on TypeScript and React/TypeScript. I did some small tutorials but with the time I had, I couldn't find much to help me with this assignment, so I decided to jump in and try with the assignment directly. I also found a website that helped me for interface/type setup: https://beshanoe.github.io/json2ts/

2.
Issue: The API wouldn't fetch due to an issue with CORS.

Solution: I thought about adding JSON locally. But since the instructions were to fetch from an API and to show that I understand asynchronous programming, I went for another solution and found services online (I used JSONbin.io) where I could upload both JSON and use these URLs instead.

3.
Issue: Styling with Material UI.

Solution: I decided to use directly the Material UI components for their clean and minimalist styling, so hopefully I won't have so much more styling to do.
