# code-challenge-footprint

## Task for this technical test
Build a TypeScript React app with two views:

* A landing page listing and sorting categories with average carbon footprint per category (fetch transaction categories)

* A dynamic detail page per category (fetch transaction data)

## My comments

### Planning

Before I started, I planned how to achieve the code challenge. Here are the steps I went through:

* I did some learning on TypeScript.
* I wrote a sketch of what I wanted it to look like, since no design was provided.
* I tested the endpoints with Postman.
* I built the folders structure in the repo.
* I tested the endpoints in the project, which lead to the CORS issue that I had to solve.
* I quickly decided to use Material UI so I did the styling all along the project.
* I did everything a little step at a time, to make sure everything was working and to detect bugs quickly, since I am very new to TypeScript, but also because I believe it's good practice.
* I added little details like the color for the footprint, an error404 page and a loader that mimics the cards for a neat look (Skeleton component from Material UI).
* I finally created some unit tests for the `averageFootprintCalculation` function.

### Issues and solutions

1.

**Issue:** No prior knowledge of TypeScript

**Solution:** I started by reading and watching some material on TypeScript and React/TypeScript. I did some small tutorials but with the time I had, I couldn't find much to help me with this assignment, so I decided to jump in and try with the assignment directly. I also found a website that helped me for interface/type setup: https://beshanoe.github.io/json2ts/, and I felt I understood it better after. I paid lots of attention to all the tooltips provided by VS Code, they were very helpful. They helped me to solve some tricky types.

**If I had more time:** Of course I would have pushed my learning even more, but I will continue right away to make some projects with TypeScript.

2.

**Issue:** The API wouldn't fetch due to an issue with CORS.

**Solution:** I thought about adding JSON locally. But since the instructions were to fetch from an API and to show that I understand asynchronous programming, I went for another solution and found services online (I used JSONbin.io) where I could upload both JSON and use these URLs instead.

3.

**Issue:** Styling with Material UI.

**Solution:** I decided to use directly the Material UI components for their clean and minimalist styling, so I didn't have more styling to do.

**If I had more time:** I would have try to make good use of much more possibilities of Material UI, since I used it only once before, and for a tiny project.

4.

**Issue:** Sorting the categories.

**Solution:** I decided to make it so the categories are alphabetically sorted by default, because the random order from the response could confuse the user who could wonder where this order comes from... I had some struggle with the useEffect hook (either too many renders if required dependencies, or warning of missing dependency if no dependency), but I read a bit about useCallback hook and used it in my AZ sorting function to fix this issue.

5.

**Issue:** Splitting in smaller components.

**Solution:** Since TypeScript is still very new to me, I struggled a bit to figure how to pass props/make interfaces, all the syntax about this, so at first I wasn't able to make smaller components that would make my code more clean and reusable (and a bit more DRY), but I had some kind of breakthrough and I managed to break it down to smaller and more reusable components.

6.

**Issue:** Nested fetch requests.

**Solution:** I had some issue with the loading combined to fetch, leading to NaN instead of numbers for average footprint in App, so I decided to nest the 2nd fetch request inside the 1st one so it doesn't interfere with setIsLoading.

**If I had more time:** I would have investigated for a cleaner way to do that, since it wouldn't be sustainable if I had multiple requests.

7.

**Issue:** Handling state.

**Solution:** I wanted at first to use Redux, but I had some difficulties related to TypeScript with Redux that I felt I may not solve in the allocated time so I decided to simply use the useState hook. I had an issue with the transactions details expanding when clicking the subcategory arrow: they were all related to the same state, so they were all open or all closed. But since I managed to understand how to pass props to a child component with TypeScript, extracting each subcategory card in its own component solved this issue.

**If I had more time:** I would have put more time on trying with Redux.

8.

**Issue:** Unit testing.

**Solution:** I have worked with unit tests only once before this, and never written any, but I did some research and tried at least to do some. I created some tests in `calc.test.ts` for the `averageFootprintCalculation` function. I made me realise that I had missed the possibility for a `categoryTransactions.length` of 0 in my calculation (which would have caused a division by 0), so I fixed it.

**If I had more time:** I would have tried to do some tests on other parts of the code.

9.

**Issue:** Structured commits.

**Solution:** I learned about conventional commits only recently and as I like clean and structured work, I try to use this structure, but I still have lots to learn and practice on naming my commits.


### Summary

This project was fun to build. It was quite a challenge for me to use TypeScript to do it, but I feel that I've learned a lot from it. It was great to use Material UI since I didn't need to reinvent the wheel to have nice looking and minimalist little cards for all categories. It allowed me to focus more on understanding the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript, and to build this project in React/TypeScript. I am quite happy with the result and all the process.
